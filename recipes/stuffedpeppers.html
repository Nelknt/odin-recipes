    <h2>About</h2>
    <body>These stuffed peppers with rice are worth a try! Ninety-four percent of all stuffed bell peppers are made because there's leftover rice around. You can adjust this recipe in many different ways: the herbs, the meat, etc. Any ground meat works: lamb, pork, or an equal mixture of sausage and beef is fantastic. I used lean beef, but I recommend trying 1 pound beef with 1/2 pound pork sausage.</body>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 bell peppers, any color</li>
        <li>3 cups chunky tomato sauce, divided</li>
        <li>½ onion, very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup beef broth</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>

        <li>Slice peppers 1/2-inch from the top; cut out stems and set aside to use as tops. Cut core from the inside of peppers and strip away any seeds. Cut off a thin slice from the bottoms so peppers can stand upright. Poke about 4 tiny holes in the bottoms to let juices drain.</li>

        <li>Lightly stuff peppers with meat mixture. Spread 1 tablespoon tomato sauce on top of each portion of stuffing; place reserved tops onto peppers. Lay a piece of parchment paper loosely on top of peppers and cover the dish tightly with foil. Place the dish on top of a baking sheet. </li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until peppers have softened slightly, about 1 hour. Remove foil and parchment paper. Continue baking until meat filling is cooked through and peppers are soft, sweet, and tender, 20 to 30 more minutes.</li>
